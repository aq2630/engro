<h4>Independent Auditor’s Review Report to the
    Members of FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan
    Limited</h4>                         
<h5>Review Report on the Statement of Compliance contained in Listed Companies
    (Code of Corporate Governance) Regulations, 2019</h5> 
    <p>We have reviewed the enclosed Statement of Compliance with the Listed Companies (Code of Corporate Governance)
        Regulations, 2019 (the Regulations) prepared by the Board of Directors of FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan Limited
        for the year ended December 31, 2019 in accordance with the requirements of regulation 36 of the Regulations.</p>                        
    <p>The responsibility for compliance with the Regulations is that of the Board of Directors of the Company. Our
        responsibility is to review whether the Statement of Compliance reflects the status of the Company’s compliance with
        the provisions of the Regulations and report if it does not and to highlight any non-compliance with the requirements
        of the Regulations. A review is limited primarily to inquiries of the Company’s personnel and review of various
        documents prepared by the Company to comply with the Regulations.</p>                        
    <p>As a part of our audit of the financial statements we are required to obtain an understanding of the accounting and
        internal control systems sufficient to plan the audit and develop an effective audit approach. We are not required to
        consider whether the Board of Directors’ statement on internal control covers all risks and controls or to form an
        opinion on the effectiveness of such internal controls, the Company’s corporate governance procedures and risks.</p>                        
    <p>The Regulations require the Company to place before the Audit Committee, and upon recommendation of the Audit
        Committee, place before the Board of Directors for their review and approval, its related party transactions and also
        ensure compliance with the requirements of section 208 of the Companies Act, 2017. We are only required and have
        ensured compliance of this requirement to the extent of the approval of the related party transactions by the Board
        of Directors upon recommendation of the Audit Committee. We have not carried out procedures to assess and
        determine the Company’s process for identification of related parties and that whether the related party transactions
        were undertaken at arm’s length price or not.</p>                        
    <p>Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention which causes us to believe that the Statement of Compliance
        does not appropriately reflect the Company's compliance, in all material respects, with the requirements contained in
        the Regulations as applicable to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2019.</p>
