            <strong class="textblack">Basis for Opinion</strong>
            <p>We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as applicable in Pakistan. Our
                responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the
                Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International

                with the Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
                for our opinion.</p>
                <strong class="textblack">Key Audit Matter</strong>
                <p>Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
                    financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial
                    statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.</p>
                    <p>Following is the Key audit matter:</p>

    <p class=""><strong>Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon</strong></p>
    <p>Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in
        the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.</p>
    <p>Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
        assurance conclusion thereon.</p>
    <p>In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
        doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
        knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have
        performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that
        fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.</p>
        <strong class="textblack">Responsibilities of Management and Board of Directors for the Financial Statements</strong>
        <p>Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
            the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in Pakistan and the requirements of Companies Act, 2017 (XIX
            of 2017) and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
            statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.</p>
            <p>In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as
                a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
                accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic
                alternative but to do so.</p>
                <p>Board of directors are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.</p>
     <strong class="textblack">Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements</strong>
     <p>Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
        material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
        Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
        ISAs as applicable in Pakistan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
        fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
        influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.</p> 
        <p>As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs as applicable in Pakistan, we exercise professional judgement and
            maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:</p>   
            <ul class="text-body">
                <li>Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
                    error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
                    sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
                    resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
                    intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.</li>
                    <li>Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
                        appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
                        Company’s internal control.</li>
                        <li>Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
                            related disclosures made by management.</li>
                        <li>Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
                            the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may
                            cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material
                            uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the
                            financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based
                            on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
                            may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.</li>
                        <li>Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,
                            and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
                            achieves fair presentation.</li>                                                               

                                </ul>       

                                <p>We communicate with the board of directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
                                    audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our
                                    audit.</p>
                                    <p>We also provide the board of directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
                                        regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be
                                        thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.</p>
                                        <p>From the matters communicated with the board of directors, we determine those matters that were of most
                                            significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We
                                            describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter
                                            or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report
                                            because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits
                                            of such communication.</p>
