                <p class="text-justify">This year, we began the next chapter of our journey as
                    FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan. A journey with a
                    very clear Purpose:</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><blockquote><strong>“We Will Transform The Health And Wellbeing of
                    Pakistani’s, Now And For Generations To Come, By
                    Nourishing Them Through Unlocking the Goodness
                    of Milk From Glass to Grass, as Well As By
                    Enhancing The Livelihood Of Farmers”</strong></blockquote></p>
                <p class="text-justify">We are committed to playing a key role in fulfilling the
                    nutritional needs of Pakistanis, and in developing the
                    Dairy sector in Pakistan, thereby increasing the income
                    of farmers, and alleviating poverty amongst our rural
                    population.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">As part of a global, Dairy powerhouse with a unique
                    heritage of over 140 years as a Cooperative, we now
                    have the opportunity, technology, knowledge and
                    methodologies to bring about an unprecedented
                    transformation in Pakistan’s Dairy industry.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">2019 was a challenging year for our company, our
                    industry, our economy and our country. Everyone, from
                    consumers to businesses, felt the inflationary impact of
                    a volatile exchange rate, in the wake of the rupee
                    devaluation. As a business with many moving parts, we
                    had to adjust our methods, expectations, and efforts.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Amidst a bleak environment, there were many wins to
                    recognise and celebrate:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Olper’s maintained market leadership with a 45%
                            share - A 815 BPS growth in comparison to January
                            2018. Loppers also achieved its highest sales in a
                            single year</li>
                        <li>Tarang achieved market leadership at 22.9% market
                            share, with a 537 BPS growth since its relaunch in
                            Feb 2018.</li>
                        <li>We successfully launched Olper’s Full Cream Milk
                            Powder (FCMP), which is steadily moving ahead
                            with an already impressive market share.</li>
                        <li>Despite a slow start to the year, Omoré delivered
                            double digit growth aided by 8 stellar innovations
                            and expansion of retail footprint.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p class="text-justify">The circumstances of these accomplishments makes
                    them all the more extraordinary.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Our human capital investments emphasized programs
                    to attract, train and develop talent to ensure the right
                    mix of people, projects and culture. In our 2019
                    Employee Engagement Survey, covering a workforce of
                    1200+ employees, 80%+ of our employees reported
                    feeling proud of our open and collaborative culture.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">On the development front, our goal was to offer more
                    personalized capability plans, for divisions to develop
                    talent for future leadership positions. One of our
                    global-driven initiatives focused on our young
                    professionals through our “Learn to Grow” program,
                    while our leaders focused on identifying and growing
                    talent, through the global “Nourishing Leadership”
                    initiative.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">2019 has underscored the need for a vibrant and
                    collaborative team to carry us forward to greater
                    heights. Equally, it has highlighted the need for us to
                    remain agile in an unpredictable environment, and to
                    adapt to a changing Dairy, economic and political
                    landscape - while remaining fully committed to our long
                    term Purpose.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I have great confidence in our team’s ability to respond
                    with speed and resolve, and convert market situations
                    into opportunities</p>
                <p class="text-justify">We go into 2020 with momentum. We continue to be
                    excited by the immense opportunity of the Pakistan
                    Dairy market, where less than 10% of milk consumed is
                    packaged, and therefore lacks nutrition and is unsafe.
                    We will continue to advocate the consumption of
                    nutritious, safe, packaged milk, and work towards our
                    goal by supporting efforts to make the public aware of
                    the facts around Dairy consumption, by working with
                    Government to enact and enforce legislation to ensure
                    quality Dairy products, and by making the right
                    products affordable and accessible to Pakistanis.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">With the right mindset we are confident we will see
                    many wins. We have strong fundamentals, a
                    comprehensive strategy, sustainable competitive
                    advantages, a robust team, vibrant operations, and a
                    future brimming with potential. Together, we will
                    transform Pakistan’s Dairy landscape.</p>
