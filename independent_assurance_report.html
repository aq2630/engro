    the Statement of Compliance with Employees Share
    Option Scheme</h4>
    <h5>Scope of our work</h5>
    <p>We have performed an independent reasonable assurance engagement of FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan Limited
        (the Company) to express an opinion on the annexed Statement of Compliance with Employees Share Option Scheme
        (the Statement), as approved by the shareholders in their Extra Ordinary General Meeting held on March 22, 2013 and
        amended in their Annual General Meeting held on April 27, 2015 (the Scheme) and Companies (Further Issue of
        Shares) Regulations, 2018 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan vide SRO 1399 (I)/2018
        dated November 14, 2018 (the Regulations), for the year ended December 31, 2019.</p>
    <h5>Applicable Criteria</h5>
    <p>The criteria for the assurance engagement against which the underlying subject matter (Statement for the year
        ended December 31, 2019) is assessed, comprise the aforementioned Scheme and the Regulations. Our engagement
        was carried out as required under Regulation No. 18 (3) (ii) of the Regulation.</p>    
    <h5>Responsibility of Company’s Management</h5>
    <p>The responsibility for the preparation of the Statement (the subject matter information) and for compliance with the
        requirements of the Scheme and the Regulations is that of the Management of the Company. The management is also
        responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of appropriate internal control procedures with respect
        to such compliance and maintenance of relevant accounting records.</p>    
    <h5>Our Independence and Quality Control</h5>
    <p>We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Ethics Standards Board
        for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants as adopted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants
        of Pakistan, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due
        care, confidentiality and professional behavior.</p> 
    <p>The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 ‘Quality Control for Firms that perform Audits and
        Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements’ and accordingly
        maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding
        compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p>   
    <h5>Responsibility of Independent Assurance Provider</h5>
    <p>Our responsibility is to express our conclusion on the Statement based on our independent assurance engagement,
        performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance
        Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ (ISAE 3000). This standard requires
        that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement reflects the
        status of Company’s compliance with the Scheme and the Regulations (the Criteria) and is free from material
        misstatement.</p>    
    <p>The procedures selected by us for the engagement depend on our judgement, including an assessment of the risks of
        material non-compliances with the requirements of the Scheme and the Regulations. In making those risk
        assessments, we have considered internal control relevant to the Company’s compliance with the Scheme and the
        Regulations in order to design procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, for gathering sufficient
        appropriate evidence to determine that the Company was not materially non-compliant with the Scheme and the
        Regulations. Our engagement was not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
        internal control. Our procedures applied to the selected data primarily comprised of:</p>
        <ul class="ul-dashed text-body">
            <li>- Verifying that only permanent employees have participated in the Scheme in compliance with the Regulations;</li>
            <li>- Verifying that variation, if any, in the terms of the Scheme has been approved by passing a special resolution
                in the general meeting;</li>
            <li>- Verifying that the share options granted, vested, lapsed, surrendered or exercised under the Scheme have
                been recorded in the books of accounts in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations;</li>
            <li>- Ensuring that adequate disclosures have been made in respect of the Scheme in the Annual Report as required
                under the Regulations; and</li>
            <li>- Ensuring that during the year no option granted to any employee has been transferred to any other person
                except to an entitled employee as per the Regulations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We believe that the evidence we have obtained through performing our aforementioned procedures is sufficient and
            appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.</p>
      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p>Based on our reasonable assurance engagement, in our opinion, the Statement for the year ended December 31, 2019,
        reflects, in all material respects, the status of Company’s compliance with the Scheme and the Regulations.</p>
