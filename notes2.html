        <p>The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
            These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">2.1 </span><strong>Basis of preparation</strong></p>
            <p><span >2.1.1 </span>These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise stated.</p>
            <p><span >2.1.2 </span>These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting and reporting standards as
                applicable in Pakistan. The accounting and reporting standards applicable in Pakistan comprise of:</p>
            <p class="px-3"><span>- </span>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards
                Board (IASB) as notified under the Companies Act, 2017; and</p>
            <p class="px-3"><span>- </span>Provisions of and directives issued under the Companies Act, 2017.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Where provisions of and directives issued under the Companies Act, 2017 differ from the IFRSs, the provisions
                of and directives issued under the Companies Act, 2017 have been followed.</p>
            <p><span >2.1.3 </span>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the above requirements requires the use of certain
                critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying
                the Companyâ€™s accounting policies. The areas involving high degree of judgement or complexity, or areas
                where assumptions and estimates are significant to these financial statements are disclosed in note 3.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">2.1.4 </span><strong>Initial application of Standards, Amendments or Interpretations to existing Standards</strong></p>
            <p class="pl-2"><span class="text-bolder">a) </span><strong>Standards and amendments to published standards that became effective during the year</strong></p>
            <p class="pl-2"><span> </span>The following new standards and interpretation to the accounting and reporting standards as applicable in
                Pakistan were effective for the first time during the year ended December 31, 2019:</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">- </span>IFRS 9 â€˜Financial instrumentsâ€™ addressed the classification, measurement and recognition of financial
                assets and financial liabilities and replaced the related guidance in lAS 39 that relates to the
                recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, de-recognition
                of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. It retained but
                simplified the mixed measurement model and established three primary measurement categories for
                financial assets: Amortized Cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) and Fair
                Value through Profit or loss (FVPL). The basis of classification depends on the Company's business
                model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity
                instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable
                option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI, without recycling fair value changes to
                profit or loss.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The standard also includes an Expected Credit losses (ECL) model that replaced the current incurred
                loss impairment model. The ECL model involves a three-stage approach whereby financial assets
                move through the three stages as the credit quality changes. The stage dictates how an entity
                measures impairment losses and applies the effective interest rate method. A simplified approach is
                permitted for financial assets that do not have a significant financing component (e.g. trade debts).</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>For financial liabilities, there are no changes to classification and measurement except for the
                recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at
                fair value through profit or loss.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>IFRS 9 also relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge
                effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging
                instrument and for the 'hedged ratio' to be the same as the one management actually use for risk
                management purposes.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The adoption of IFRS 9 from January 1, 2019 by the Company has resulted in change in accounting
                policies (notes 2.5 and 2.6), and as per the Company's business model, its financial assets and
                liabilities have been defined into appropriate IFRS 9 categories (i.e. mainly financial assets previously
                classified as loan and receivables have now been classified as amortized cost.</p>
            <p><span >- </span>IFRS 15 â€˜Revenue from contracts with customersâ€™ (effective January 1, 2019). This standard deals with
                revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial
                statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
                an entityâ€™s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a
                good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or
                service. The standard replaces IAS 18 â€˜Revenueâ€™ and IAS 11 â€˜Construction contractsâ€™ and related
                interpretations. The adoption of IFRS 15 from January 1, 2019 has resulted in change in accounting
                policies (note 2.20), however, the impact of its adoption is not considered material on these financial
                statements.</p>
            <p><span >- </span>Effective January 1, 2019, the Company has adopted IFRS 16, 'Leases' which replaced guidance on
                accounting for leases, including IAS 17 'Leases', IFRIC 4 'Determining whether an arrangement
                contains a Lease', SIC-15 'Operating Leases- Incentive and SIC-27 'Evaluating the substance of
                transactions involving the legal form of a Lease'. IFRS 16 introduced a single, on balance sheet lease
                accounting model for the Company. The Company has recognized a right-of-use asset representing its
                right-of-use of the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligations to make lease
                payments. The accounting polices relating to Company' right of use asset and lease liability are
                disclosed in note 2.15.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The Company has adopted IFRS 16 retrospectively from January 1, 2019, but has not restated
                comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transitional provisions in
                the standard. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are
                therefore recognised in the opening balance sheet on January 1, 2019.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>On adoption of IFRS 16, the Company recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had
                previously been classified as â€˜operating leasesâ€™ under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities
                were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the
                Company's incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>For leases previously classified as finance leases the Company recognised the carrying amount of the
                lease asset and lease liability immediately before transition as the carrying amount of the right of use
                asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application. The measurement principles of IFRS 16
                are applied only after that date. The re-measurements to the lease liabilities were recognised as
                adjustments to the related right-of-use assets immediately after the date of initial application.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The right-of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the
                amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease already recognised in the
                statement of financial position as at December 31, 2018.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The change in accounting policy affected the following items in the statement of financial position on
                January 1, 2019:</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>- Property, plant and equipment â€“ decreased by Rs. 241,024<br />
                - Right-of-use asset â€“ increased by Rs. 809,598<br />
                - Prepayments â€“ decreased by Rs. 6,905<br />
                - Liability against assets subject to finance lease - decreased by Rs. 121,506<br />
                - Lease liabilities â€“ increased by Rs. 683,175</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The change in accounting policy affected the following items in profit or loss for the year ended December
                31, 2019:</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>- Markup on lease liability against right-of-use assets - increased by Rs. 67,399<br />
                - Cost of sales which includes depreciation and rent expenses decreased by Rs. 18,471<br />
                - Distribution and marketing expenses which include depreciation and rent expenses decreased by
                Rs. 4,498<br />
                - Administrative expenses which include depreciation and rent expenses decreased by Rs.12,855</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The net impacts on loss before tax, loss for the year and loss per share is a decrease by Rs.31,535,
                Rs.22,418 and Rs 0.03 respectively.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>IFRIC (Interpretation) 23, â€˜Uncertainty over income tax treatmentsâ€™. This IFRIC clarifies how the
                recognition and measurement requirements of IAS 12 â€˜Income taxesâ€™, are applied where there is
                uncertainty over income tax treatments. The interpretation had clarified previously that IAS 12, not
                IAS 37 â€˜Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assetsâ€™, applies to accounting for uncertain
                income tax treatments. The interpretation explains how to recognize and measure deferred and
                current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. An uncertain
                tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over whether that
                treatment will be accepted by the tax authority. The interpretation applies to all aspects of income tax
                accounting where there is an uncertainty regarding the treatment of an item, including taxable profit
                or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates. The interpretation
                does not have a significant impact on these financial statements.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The other amendments to published standards and interpretations that are mandatory for the financial
                year which began on January 1, 2019 are considered not to be relevant or to have any significant impact on
                the Company's financial reporting and operations and are therefore not disclosed in these financial
                statements.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">b) </span><strong>Standards, amendments and interpretation to published standards that are not yet effective and
                have not been early adopted by the Company</strong></p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The following new standards, amendments and interpretations are not effective for the financial year that
                began on January 1, 2019 and have not been early adopted by the Company:</p>
            <p><span >- </span>Amendments to IAS 1, â€˜Presentation of financial statementsâ€™, and IAS 8, â€˜Accounting policies, changes
                in accounting estimates and errorsâ€™ (effective for the Company's annual period beginning on January
                1, 2019). These amendments and consequential amendments to other IFRSs: (i) use a consistent
                definition of materiality throughout IFRSs and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting; (ii)
                clarify the explanation of the definition of material; and (iii) incorporate some of the guidance in IAS 1
                about immaterial information. These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on
                the Company's financial statements.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>There is a standard and amendments to the published standards that are not yet effective and are also not
                relevant to the Company's financial statements and therefore, have not been presented in these financial
                statements.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">2.2 </span><strong>Property, plant and equipment</strong></p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Owned</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>These are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any, except for freehold land and
                capital work-in-progress, which are stated at cost.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Depreciation is charged to profit or loss using the straight-line method whereby the cost of an operating asset
                less its estimated residual value is written off over its estimated useful life at rates given in note 4.1.
                Depreciation on additions is charged from the month in which the asset is available for use and on disposals up
                to the preceding month of disposal.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives and such are material,
                those are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Subsequent costs are included in the assetâ€™s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as
                appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
                Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to
                profit or loss during the year in which these are incurred.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An
                assetâ€™s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assetâ€™s carrying amount
                is greater than its estimated recoverable amount and the resulting impairment loss is recognized in profit or
                loss. The recoverable amount is higher of fair value, less cost of disposal and value in use. Reversal of
                impairment is effected in the case of indications of a change in recoverable amount and is recognized in profit
                or loss, however, is restricted to the original cost of the asset.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The gain or loss on disposal or retirement of an asset represented by the difference between the sale proceeds
                and the carrying amount of the asset is recognized as an income or expense in the period of disposal or
                retirement.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">2.3 </span><strong>Biological assets</strong></p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Livestock are measured at their fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs. Fair value of livestock is
                determined by an external valuer on the basis of best available estimates for livestock of similar attributes.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs of livestock are recognized
                in profit or loss.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Crops in the ground and at the point of harvest at the reporting date are measured at cost being an
                approximation of fair value, as these are presently being used as internal consumption for cattle feed and have
                a very short biological transformation and consumption cycle.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">2.4 </span><strong>Intangibles - Computer software</strong></p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Intangibles are recognized if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset
                will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can also be measured reliably.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Generally, costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as
                incurred. However, costs that are directly associated with identifiable software and have probable economic
                benefits exceeding the cost beyond one year, are recognized as intangibles. Direct costs include the purchase
                cost of software and related overhead cost.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Expenditure which enhances or extends the performance of computer software beyond its original
                specification and useful life is recognized as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the
                software.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Computer software cost treated as intangibles are amortized from the date the software is put to use on
                straight-line basis over a period of 5 years. The carrying amount of the intangibles is reviewed for impairment
                whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An
                impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
                amount in profit or loss. Reversal of impairment losses are also recognized in profit or loss.</p>

            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flow represents solely
                payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial
                assets, impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses, and gain or loss arising on de-recognition
                are recognised directly in profit or loss.</p>
            <p><span>b) </span>Fair value through other comprehensive income</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are held within a business model
                whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the
                contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
                payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.</p>
            <p><span>c) </span>Fair value through profit or loss</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income
                or assets that are designated at fair value through profit or loss using fair value option, are measured at
                fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair
                value through profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Equity instrument financial assets are measured at fair value at and subsequent to initial recognition.
                Changes in fair value of these financial assets are normally recognised in profit or loss. Dividends from
                such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss when the Companyâ€™s right to receive
                payment is established. Where an election is made to present fair value gains and losses on equity
                instruments in other comprehensive income there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains
                and losses to profit or loss following the de-recognition of the investment.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration given
                and received respectively. These financial assets and liabilities are subsequently remeasured to fair value,
                amortized cost or cost as the case may be. Any gain or loss on the recognition and de-recognition of the
                financial assets and liabilities is included in profit or loss for the period in which it arises.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Financial assets are de-recognised when the Company loses control of the contractual rights that
                comprise the financial asset. Assets or liabilities that are not contractual in nature and that are created
                as a result of statutory requirements imposed by the Government are not the financial instruments of
                the Company.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">2.5.2 </span><strong>Financial Liabilities</strong></p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Financial liabilities are recognised at the time when the Company becomes a party to the contractual
                provisions of the instrument. Financial liabilities at amortised cost are initially measured at fair value less
                transaction costs. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value and
                transaction costs are expensed in profit or loss.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Financial liabilities, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are subsequently measured at
                amortised cost using the effective yield method.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.
                Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender or substantially different
                terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange and modification is
                treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in
                respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">2.5.3 </span><strong>Offsetting</strong></p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>A financial asset and financial liability is off-set and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial
                position when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off the transaction and also there is an intention to
                settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">2.6 </span><strong>Impairment</strong></p>
            <p><span>a) </span>Financial assets</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its financial
                assets. The Company applies the simplified approach to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for
                trade debts.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis. The remaining
                financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The Company recognises in profit or loss, as an impairment gain or loss, the amount of expected credit
                losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date.</p>
            <p><span>b) </span>Non-Financial assets</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The carrying amounts of non-financial assets are assessed at each reporting date to ascertain whether
                there is any indication of impairment. If such an indication exists, the assetâ€™s recoverable amount is
                estimated to determine the extent of impairment loss, if any. An impairment loss is recognized as an
                expense in profit or loss. The recoverable amount is the higher of an assetâ€™s fair value less cost of
                disposal and value-in-use. Value-in-use is ascertained through discounting of the estimated future cash
                flows using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
                risk specific to the assets. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
                levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>An impairment loss is reversed if there is a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable
                amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assetâ€™s carrying amount does not
                exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no
                impairment loss had been recognized.</p>

            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>These are valued at weighted average cost except for items in transit, which are stated at invoice value plus
                other charges paid thereon till the reporting date. A provision is made for any excess book value over
                estimated realizable value of items identified as surplus to the Companyâ€™s requirements. Adequate provision is
                also made for slow moving and obsolete items.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Spare parts of capital nature which can be used only in connection with an item of property, plant and
                equipment are shown separately as major spare parts and stand-by equipment.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder">2.8 </span><strong>Stock-in-trade</strong></p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Stock-in-trade is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using weighted
                average method except for raw materials in transit which are stated at invoice value plus other charges paid
                thereon till the reporting date. Cost of finished goods comprises purchase cost and other manufacturing
                expenses. The cost of work in process includes material and proportionate conversion costs.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Milk is initially measured at its fair value less estimated point-of-sale costs at the time of milking. The fair value
                of milk is determined based on market prices in the local area.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Net realizable value signifies the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost
                of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Provision is made for slow moving stocks where
                considered necessary.</p>

            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Trade debts and other receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional,
                unless such contain significant financing component in which case such are recognised at fair value. The
                Company holds the trade debts and other receivables with the objective of collecting the contractual cash flows
                and therefore measures the receivables subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
                Impairment of trade debts and other receivables is described in note 2.6.</p>

            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Ordinary shares are classified as equity and are recorded at their face value. Incremental costs, if any, directly
                attributable to the issue of new shares or options, are recognized in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the
                proceeds.</p>

            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The grant date fair value of equity settled share based payments to employees is initially recognized in the
                statement of financial position as deferred employee compensation expense with a consequent credit to equity
                as employee share option compensation reserve. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity
                settled share based payments is recognized as an employee compensation expense on a straight line basis over

            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Effective January 1, 2019, at inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether a contract is, or contains,
                a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of
                time in exchange for consideration. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range
                of different terms and conditions.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic
                incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods
                after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to extended (or
                not terminated).</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments over the period of lease term
                and that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if
                that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable, variable lease payment that are
                based on an index or a rate which are initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date,
                amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a
                purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for
                terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option. The extension and termination
                options are incorporated in determination of lease term only when the Company is reasonably certain to
                exercise these options.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The
                lease liability is also remeasured to reflect any reassessment or lease modification, or to reflect revised
                in-substance fixed lease payment.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The lease liability is remeasured when the Company reassesses the reasonable certainty of exercise of
                extension or termination option upon occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change in
                circumstance, or when there is a change in assessment of an option to purchase underlying asset, or when
                there is a change in amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or when there is a
                change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payment.
                The corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-to-use asset, or is recorded in profit
                and loss if the carrying amount of right-to-use asset has been reduced to zero.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>A change in scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and
                conditions of the lease is accounted for as a lease modification. The lease modification is accounted for as a
                separate lease if modification increase the scope of lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying
                assets and the consideration for lease increases by an amount that is commensurate with the stand-alone price
                for the increase in scope adjusted to reflect the circumstances of the particular contracts, if any. When the
                lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, the lease liability is remeasured and corresponding
                adjustment is made to right-of-use asset.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The right-of-use asset is initially measured based on the initial measurement of lease liability adjusted for any
                lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an
                estimate of costs to be incurred to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying
                asset or the site on which it is located.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost model. The right of use asset is depreciated on a
                straight line method over the lease term as this method most closely reflects the expected pattern of
                consumption of future economic benefits. The right-of-use asset is reduced by impairment losses, if any, and
                adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability.</p>
            <p><span class="text-bolder"> </span>The Company has elected to apply the practical expedient not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease
                liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. The
                lease payments associated with these leases is recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease
                term.</p>
