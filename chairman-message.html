                <p class="text-justify">I am pleased to present to you the review for the year
                    2019. This has been a very challenging year for the
                    Country as well as the Company. Sharp economic
                    headwinds, particularly steep increases in commodity
                    costs due to devaluation of rupee and rising interest
                    rates, have put pressure on the overall Company
                    profitability. Despite these economic headwinds, the
                    Company has delivered a topline growth of 20% backed
                    by a robust volume growth of 17%. This has materialized
                    in an environment where most FMCG companies have
                    struggled to increase volumes.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan will play an
                    extremely important role in the development of dairy
                    sector in Pakistan. Our journey of nourishment helps
                    communities reach their potential. We are committed
                    to providing better nutrition to our consumers. As the
                    population of Pakistan crosses 300 million by 2050, we
                    will be there to serve the nation with affordable, safe
                    and constantly improving dairy products. We have a
                    unique opportunity to create a positive impact on the
                    entire dairy value chain, by working directly with the
                    farmers. This will help to improve their livelihood,
                    maximize their incomes and increase their contribution
                    towards the Country’s GDP.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Our Dairy Development Programs are designed to
                    ensure inclusive growth and increased prosperity for
                    Farmers. Since inception we have empowered 25,000+
                    women farmers by making them a part of our
                    ecosystem, training them to enhance their yield and
                    promoting socio-economic inclusion. In 2019 alone, we
                    helped train 53000+ farmers on best dairy farming
                    practices. We are proud that our efforts have been
                    recognised nationally and internationally for the impact
                    created through our programs. Our passion is to drive
                    growth and progress through milk to create a positive
                    change in the everyday lives of Pakistanis.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">At present more than 90% of our population consumes
                    milk that is neither processed nor tested for quality.
                    This leads to a high probability of consuming hazardous
                    concentration of bacteria and aflatoxins that may be
                    present in the milk. The focus of the Company is to
                    drive conversion from unsafe loose milk to safe and
                    hygienic products. This is an uphill task especially when
                    one considers that loose milk industry is unregulated.
                    However, the Company believes this to be the right
                    approach for creating a nourishing Pakistan. We are
                    motivated to build awareness and communicate the
                    benefits of safe packaged milk to the consumers, to
                    ensure that the consumers across Pakistan are aware
                    and have access to safe, high quality and nourishing
                    products.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The company steered through the challenges of 2019
                    with the invaluable input of the visionary business
                    leaders on its board. The Board of Directors played a
                    pivotal role in setting the strategic direction of the
                    company. The members of the Board bring unique
                    insights, both local and international due to their vast
                    business experience. The Company has a unique
                    opportunity to have positive impact in the entire dairy
                    value chain by working side by side with all relevant
                    stakeholders.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">We look forward to working with the various
                    Government bodies, to bring about regulatory changes
                    focused on delivering nutrition to the population,
                    through conversion of loose milk to packaged milk.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Last but not the least, I would like to thank you for your
                    continued support, the Management and the wider
                    team of the Company for their commitment and focus
