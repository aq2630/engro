                    <p class="text-justify">On behalf of the Board of Directors of FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan Limited (a majority owned subsidiary of FrieslandCampina Pakistan Holdings B.V. which is a subsidiary of Zuivelcoöperatie FrieslandCampina UA (the Ultimate Parent Company) and based in Netherlands), we are pleased to present the annual report and the audited financial information of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2019.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5 colorblue">Business Overview</h3>
                    <p class="text-justify">In 2019, the Company continued its strong growth momentum and delivered a robust topline growth in each of the four quarters. The Company has reported a revenue of Rs. 38.9 bn in 2019, recording a 20% increase vs last year. This growth came primarily on the back of strong volumetric gains in both Dairy and Ice Cream business segments. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Sharp economic headwinds, particularly steep increases in commodity costs due to devaluation of Rupee and rising interest rates, have put pressure on overall company profitability. As a result, gross margin reduced from 16% to 13%. The Company has taken price increases across its portfolio in the last 6 months to offset these inflationary pressures. The interest cost for the Company has almost doubled primarily on account of higher interest rates. A once-off tax adjustment of Rs 153 million was also recorded due to revision in the Finance Act 2019. As a result, the Company registered a loss after tax of Rs 955 million vs a profit of Rs 64 million (loss per share of Rs 1.25 vs a profit per share of Rs 0.08) in the same period last year.</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">The segment has maintained the strong growth momentum in both its core brands, i.e. Olpers and Tarang, which continue to win in the market on the back of significant brand investments since their relaunch last year. The segment has grown volumes by 17% whilst the consumer goods sector has been relatively stagnant. The growth was aided by an effective communication spend and expansion in retail coverage by more than 12,000 outlets. As a result, both Olpers and Tarang have gained market share leadership in their respective categories. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The Company’s new launches in 2019, i.e. Olpers full cream milk powder (FCMP), Olpers Creams, Olpers Pro-Cal and Tarang Elaichi, have received a positive response from both consumers and trade and have gained a healthy market share in a short span of time <img src="./images/profit-amount.png" class="img-fluid mx-3 my-3 float-right" /> despite strong competition from established players. The Company will continue to leverage FrieslandCampina’s global expertise to introduce new products and innovations as a key driver of future business growth.  </p>

Over the years, the Company has embarked on ambitious plans to achieve Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA - USA) compliance through DuPont Alignment and has been successful in its endeavors. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">A work-place safety program has been implemented, that actively seeks to reduce the potential risk of injuries within the work-place by conducting safety gap analysis. Since DuPont Safety Management is essentially a people-focused tool, the Company has also invested heavily in employee engagement by conducting trainings that spanned over the year, with a cumulative total of 13,000+ training hours. To reaffirm its commitment to safety of its employees and draw maximum buy-in, the Company hosted a series of engagement events including Safety Weeks & Safety Champions of the Month.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Alignment with FrieslandCampina Global HSE Management System ‘FOQUS SHE’ was carried out and the Company became the first Operational Company in FrieslandCampina world that achieved “Satisfactory” result in its first assessment. To further increase awareness of employees on serious injuries & threatening risks at work places, introduction of Seven ‘Life Saving Rules’ was one of the major value additions in 2019. To make its factories compliant with ATEX (EU Directives for controlling explosive atmospheres), assessment of ‘Powder Dust Explosion Hazard’ was carried out along with action plan. Moving forward in 2020, Machine Safety Assessment is one of the key areas where the Company is committed to add value.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">As a result of its efforts and focus on stringent and best
                        in class HSE guidelines, the Total Recordable Injury
                        Rate (TRIR) has declined significantly over the last six

                <h3 class="mt-5 colorblue">FUTURE OUTLOOK</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The Directors confirm compliance with the Corporate and Financial Reporting Framework of the SECP Code of Governance for the following:</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The business continues to be impacted by an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment with rising inflation and eroding consumer purchasing power. All these factors pose significant challenges to the business profitability in the short term.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">The Company’s purpose is to provide a nutritious and safe offering to our consumers. The main source of growth for the Company is conversion from loose milk, which still represents ~90% (20+ billion litres) of untapped opportunity. Loose milk has been scientifically proven to be unsafe for human consumption as a sizeable portion of this segment operates with unacceptable business practices including adulteration, unhygienic conditions and conveyance methods, whilst also contributing negligibly to the government exchequer. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">The Company will continue to: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Invest in strengthening its brand equity and offer innovative products to remain the preferred choice for consumers’ dairy needs. </li>
                    <li>Work with the Pakistan Dairy Association (PDA) on various category development initiatives to educate the consumers on the potential health hazards of loose milk consumption and reinforce the positive characteristics of packaged milk. </li>
                    <li>Work with the regulatory authorities through relevant business platforms to harmonize the Federal and Provincial food laws and draft legislation on minimum pasteurization. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-justify">The growth of dairy industry is an extension of the Government’s agenda of improving health and nutrition of masses, hence the Company will encourage the Government to support in creating mass awareness around safe milk consumption and financially incentivize the growth of formal dairy sector through favourable fiscal policies. </p>
                <p>Every day, millions of consumers enjoy our products throughout Pakistan, hence the Company remains committed to highest standards in the field of food safety, sustainability and transparency throughout the entire production chain, i.e. “from grass to glass”. The Company will leverage FrieslandCampina’s expertise and heritage of 145+ years to continue to provide affordable, high quality, healthy and safe dairy products. </p>
